        <p>Our motivation for this project is also our great desire for human society to develop and grow in different domains and at the same time to do research on things that will make them enjoy life more, to live it, because the human race is in a continuous evolution and movement, and every day can bring something new, with a completion of the past day, a new rediscovery. HexaPolis is the key for a better life, a life of the new, the unknown, of trials, discoveries and development in a unique realm. Cosmic space is an infinite space, a space that can be in continuous research, a completely new world that hexa polis wants to better understand and discover. </p>

            <p>My name is Ana-Maria, and my main focus on this project was the technical design and CAD of the spaceship. I am very passionate about programming, technology, and building robots for various competitions or personal projects. This has led me to develop quite a lot of mechanical and practical skills, like 3D modeling and 3D printing, to aid the construction process of my designs. I believe technology has a very big influence on society and our daily lives, and understanding how it works can be a huge advantage for anyone.</p>
